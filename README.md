# My Portfolio
This is my portfolio that will tell you everything about me, from what I study to my hobbies and more.

# Design Process
For the design of this webpage, I ensure that most of the important information is at the left or center of the page. This is because whenever I enter a site, I usually have my eyes fixated on the left to center of the page as it loads, and thus the first words that I read are will be from the left or the center.
